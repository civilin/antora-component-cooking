. Add carrots, potatoes, celery, and thyme to the pressure cooker. Cook for another 3 minutes.
. Pour in stock and let it boil. Regularly stir to scrape off any brown bits at the base of the pan.

. Serve!

== Notes

The recipe is also great for chicken thighs, especially if you prefer to have more flavour
Other vegetables can be used, too: zucchini, sweet potato, or pumpkin, among many others.

Use fresh thyme if you want; this can also add more flavour.

If you prefer a thicker soup consistency, add 2 tsps of cornflour mixed in a glass of cold water to the stew; let it boil and simmer for 3 minutes.
