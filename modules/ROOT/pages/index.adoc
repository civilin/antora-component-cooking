Most of my recipes can be prepared in an Instant Pot pressure cooker. If you don't have one, I highly recommend the Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-in-1 Programmable Pressure Cooker.

I recently purchased this Instant Pot pressure cooker. When it arrived, I set about cooking things I had never attempted before. I cooked Mexican Lasagna, Beef Burgandy, Chicken Stew, Beef and Broccoli over brown rice, and Chicken Piccata.  All of these recipes are easy to prepare with the cooker. Meat always comes out tender. The process locks in flavors. Pressure cooking saves time. I heartily recommend http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-IP-DUO60-Programmable-Stainless/dp/B00FLYWNYQ[this gadget^]!

It handles multiple tasks well. In addition to pressure cooking, I used it to brown meat, to make brown rice, to steam broccoli and took keep meals warm until we were ready to eat them. You can prepare "slow cooker" recipes in minutes rather than hours. But you can slow cook if you want to. The Chinese food tasted as good as take out. The meat was more tender, having been pressure-cooked instead of stir-fried.

Electric pressure cookers bear no resemblance to the dangerous hissing tank grandma had in her kitchen. You literally select a preset and forget it. Except of course that you're hungry and it cooks meals fast.
